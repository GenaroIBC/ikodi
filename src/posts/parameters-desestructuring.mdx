# Parameters Desestructuring: a modern and elegant approach

## Introduction

When we are developing complex applications, a typical problem we may face is to call a function or method that has a lot of parameters, and we need to remember what is the right order for the arguments:

<Code language="JavaScript">
```javascript

updateSomeState(oldState, newState, true, 0) // is this even right

```

</Code>


<Note type="warning">
  At this point you can think that we aren't separating logic properly, and you may be right, but it's for example's sake.
</Note>
```

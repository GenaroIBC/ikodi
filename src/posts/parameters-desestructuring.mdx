# Named parameters: a modern and elegant approach

## Introduction

When we are developing complex applications, a typical problem we may face is that we call a function or method that has many parameters, and we need to remember what the correct order is:

<Code language="JavaScript">
```javascript

updateSomeState(oldState, newState, true, 0); // is this even right ü§î ?

````

</Code>


<Note type="info">
  At this point you may think that we aren't separating the logic properly, and you may be right, but it's for example's sake.
</Note>

A good approach to solving this problem is parameters destructuring (or named parameters). But first, let's review the destructuring syntax.

### Basic destructuring

<Code language="JavaScript">

```javascript
const IKodi = {
  author: "Genaro Bonavita",
  topics: ["programming", "JavaScript", "web development"]
};


const { author, topics } = IKodi; // creates two constants called 'author' and 'topics'

console.log(author); // "Genaro Bonavita"
console.log(topics[2]); // "web development"
````

</Code>

<br />

### Default values

If the properties we are looking for are not defined, the variables (or constants) are `undefined`, but we can avoid this by setting a default value:

<Code language="JavaScript">

```javascript
const { author = "Anonymous", topics = [] } = IKodi;

console.log(author); // if not defined, it will be assigned "Anonymous"
console.log(topics[2]); // if not defined, it will be assigned []
```

</Code>

<Note type="warn">
  The default assignment only applies if the property is `undefined`, meaning
  that if it's `null` (or any other _falsy_ value) the created variable will be
  assigned that _no-undefined_ value.
</Note>

### Renaming destructured properties

Usually (for example when handling APIs responses), a property has the same name as one of our variables, or it's not descriptive enough (e.g. "data" or "response") and we want to rename it. We can rename the destructured property like so:

<Code language="JavaScript">

```javascript
const { author: postAuthor, topics: postTopics } = IKodi;

console.log(postAuthor); // all OK üëç
console.log(postTopics[2]); // all OK üëç

console.log(author); // ReferenceError ‚ö†Ô∏è because doesn't exists
console.log(topics[2]); // ReferenceError ‚ö†Ô∏è because doesn't exists
```

</Code>

### Combined syntax

An example combining destructuring, default values and properties renaming:

<Code language="JavaScript">

```javascript
const { author: postAuthor = "Anonymus", topics: postTopics = [] } = IKodi;

console.log(postAuthor); // "Genaro Bonavita", but "Anonymus" if not defined
console.log(postTopics[2]); // "web development", but [] if not defined
```

</Code>

First we put the name of the original property, then the new name, and finally the default value.

## Named Parameters

All these destructuring concepts apply to function parameters as well.

<Note type="warn">
  If you are using the modern parameter syntax explained above, you won't be
  able to use the _use strict_ mode inside the function body.
</Note>

<Code language="JavaScript">

```javascript
// with normal parameters
function removeRepeatedItems(items) {
  return Array.from(new Set(items));
}

// with named parameters
function removeRepeatedItems({ items = [] }) {
  return Array.from(new Set(items));
}
```

</Code>

The second `removeRepeatedItems` function takes an _object_ as argument and **destructures** the _items_ property.

So, going back with the first example in this article, we can do the following:

<Code language="JavaScript">

```javascript
updateSomeState({ oldState, newState, priority: true, destroyedNodes: 0 }); // this is more descriptive now
```

</Code>

## Wrapping Up

In this article, we learned the _destructuring syntax_, and combined it with named parameters, in order to have a better control over our code.

As you can see, it can be a useful approach when working on a large or complex codebase, because we're taking advantage of a native feature to reduce complexity, while improving the readability and maintainability of our code.

However, it is in your hands to decide if using it can help more than hinder. In the end, you have one more tool at your disposal.

# Working with the Local Storage API in JavaScript

_Local Storage_ is a **browser API** that let us **persist information** in the
browser storage, allowing us to save useful information about _user
preferences_, such as theme, language, etc...

As you can imagine, it is a very convenient way to personalize user experience.

<Note type="warning">
  Due it is a browser API, you can't use it in runtimes like Node, Deno, Bun,
  etc.., though there are several alternatives for the server.
</Note>
---

## Main Concepts

The way Local Storage stores data is similar to an ordinary JavaScript object, that is a set of _key_ and _value_ pairs:

<Code language="JavaScript">

```javascript
const object = {
  firstKey: "hello",
  secondKey: "world"
};
```

</Code>

<br />

We can access the Local Storage data table directly in the browser DevTools:

1. Open a new empty tab
1. Go to the developer tools.
1. Navigate to _Application > Storage > Local Storage_
   ![Application window](/img/first.png)
1. Select the first URL from the list
   ![URLs list](/img/second.png)

You can see something like this:
![Local Storage data table](/img/third.png)

<br />

To add a new key/value pair, double click below the _key_ column and enter a key (for example _"message"_). Then go to the _value_ field and enter a value (for example _"local storage"_).

If we reload the page, we can see that the data we've just added is still there:
![Data is still there](/img/fourth.png)

<br />

Now: how can we bring this to JavaScript?

Well, it's pretty simple, but you need to know something very important first: **Local Storage can only store data as a _`string`_**, so we need to stringify it first.

The way JavaScript lets us do it is via the global `JSON` object methods:

- `JSON.stringify()` accepts a valid JavaScript value (object, array, number, etc...) and returns a stringified copy:

<Code language="JavaScript">

```javascript
JSON.stringify({
  name: "foo",
  age: 23
}); // returns "{name:"foo",age:23}"
```

</Code>

- `JSON.parse()` accepts a valid **stringified** JavaScript
  value and returns its equivalent JavaScript value:

<Code language="JavaScript">

```javascript
JSON.parse("{name:'foo',age:23}"); // returns {
//   name: "foo",
//   age: 23
// }
```

</Code>

<br />

With this in mind, we are ready to interact with the Local Storage via JavaScript.

The Local Storage API provides us the following methods:

<Code language="JavaScript">

```javascript
localStorage.setItem(<key>, <stringified-data>) // to save data

localStorage.getItem(<key>) // to get saved data by key

localStorage.key(<index>) // to get saved data by index

localStorage.removeItem(<key>) // to remove saved data

localStorage.clear() // to empty storage
```

</Code>

## A Real Use Case

So, let's imagine a real-world example: We need to remember the user's preferred language every time they enter the app.

For this example, i'm going to use vanila JS, but it is easily extrapolated to any library/framework.

<Code language="HTML">

```html
<select name="language" id="language-select">
  <option value="en">English</option>
  <option value="es">Español</option>
  <option value="pt">Português</option>
  ...
</select>
```

</Code>

We create a _select_ element with language options and we add it the _language-select_ id.

<br />

<Code language="JavaScript">

```javascript
// we listen for "change" events in the document
document.addEventListener("change", event => {
  // we check if the event comes from our select element
  if (event.target.matches("#language-select")) {
    // if so, we get the selected value
    const selectedLanguage = event.target.value;

    // and we save it in the Local Storage
    localStorage.setItem("language", selectedLanguage);
  }
});
```

</Code>

With JavaScript, we add an _event listener_ for the entire document.

<Note type="info">
  When I work with vanila JavaScript, I add only one event listener for each
  event I need to handle, in order to prevent _event propagation_ and reduce the
  number of event listeners in the app.
</Note>

Once we've added our _change_ event listener, we check if the event target (the element that fired the event) is our _select_. If so, we get its value (in our example it would be _en_, _es_ or _pt_) and save it in the Local Storage.

<Note type="warning">
  Note that we are not converting our value to a string because it is already a
  string.
</Note>

Now, we can do the following:

<Code language="JavaScript">

```javascript
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  const userLanguage = localStorage.getItem("language");

  setLanguage(userLanguage);
  // ...
});
```

</Code>

When the page has loaded and the DOM is ready, we get the saved language from Local Storage. From here, we can use it for whatever we need.

Also, a good feature is that users can reset their language preference, and for this we would need to remove it from Local Storage:

<Code language="JavaScript">
```javascript
  function resetLanguage() {
    localStorage.removeItem("language");
  }
```
</Code>

And, finally, in an unlikely scenario, we could completly empty the Local Storage:

<Code language="JavaScript">

```javascript
localStorage.clear();
```

</Code>

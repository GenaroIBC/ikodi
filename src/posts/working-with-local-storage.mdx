# Working with the Local Storage API in JavaScript

_Local Storage_ is an **browser API** that let us **persist information** in the
browser storage, allowing us to save useful information about _user
preferences_, such as theme, language, etc...

As you can imagine, it is a very convenient way to personalize user experience.

## Getting Started

The way Local Storage stores data is similar to an ordinary JavaScript object: a set of `key` and `value` pairs

```javascript
const object = {
  firstKey: "hello",
  secondKey: "world"
};
```

In the browser interface, it looks like this:

| key  | value       |
| :--- | :---------- |
| name | Hello world |

We can access the Local Storage data table directly in the browser DevTools:

1. Open a new empty tab
1. Go to the developer tools.
1. Navigate to _Application > Storage > Local Storage_
1. Select the current URL from the list

You can see something like this:

<br />

To add a new `key`-`value` pair, double click below the _key_ column and enter a key (for example _"message"_). Then go to the `value` field and enter a value (for example _"local storage"_).

If we reload the page, we can see that the data we've just added is still there.

<br />

Now: how can we bring this to JavaScript?

Well, it's pretty simple, but you need to know something very important first: **Local Storage can only store data as a _`string`_**, so we need to stringify it.

The way JavaScript lets us do it is via the `JSON object methods`:

- `JSON.stringify()` accepts a valid JavaScript value (object, array, number, etc...) and returns a stringified copy:

```javascript
JSON.stringify({
  name: "foo",
  age: 23
}); // returns a string
```

- `JSON.parse()` accepts a valid **stringified** JavaScript
  value and returns a valid JavaScript value:

```javascript
JSON.parse("{name:'foo',age:23}"); // returns a JavaScript object
```

With this in mind, we are ready to interact with the Local Storage programmatically:

The Local Storage API provides us the following methods:

- `localStorage.setItem(<key>, <stringified-data>)` // to set

- `localStorage.clear()`

- `localStorage.clear()`

- `localStorage.clear()`
